Clicker App

The game is basically clicking and keep clicking. The upgrade part, first one mmake increase double amount so the cost is 64 multiplication. So next time you need 128 and 256 so on. Also the last three updrade make automatically increase the click fist one is 1 click per second and second one is 100 then 1000.
